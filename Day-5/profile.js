          Hello everyone! My name is Nicolus. I am from Mumbai, Maharashtra. I am a fresh graduate 
          excited to embark in the IT field. I've completed my initial studies from St. Thomas International 
          School. After that I pursued B.Sc. in Computer Science from XYZ Technical Institute. I graduated 
          with 88%. Growing up, I have always been attracted to computers and technology. As soon as I could,
           I taught myself the skills needed to make a successful career in the IT field. During my studies,
            I have gained knowledge in networking, coding, design, and system security. I am an organized and 
            motivated individual with a strong sense of ethics and an eagerness to succeed. With my technical 
            knowledge and strong problem-solving skills, I am confident that I will be a great asset to the 
            company. Thank you.
